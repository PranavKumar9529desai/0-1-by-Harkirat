Problems faced whioe trying tot connected the Mongodb-compass to the local.

connection_url/your_database_name 

then use the database will automatically create collection based on the your model name.foe ex 
if your model name is "Course" then it will create the collection as "courses".

const User=mongoose.model("User",userSchema);    // users collection will be created in the database.

'mongodb://0.0.0.0/Myserver // this is the connection url for the mongodb compass.
here 0.0.0.0 is the ip address of the local machine.
instead of this you can use the localhost also.


const ImageSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    url: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        // You can add more validation options specific to the image field if needed
    }
});

// Define the main schema referencing the ImageSchema for the "image" field
const CourseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    id: Number,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    price: Number,
    image: {
        type: ImageSchema,
        required: true,
    }
});



in Usermiddelware.js tou can see the If the user exists, next() is called, and control is passed to the route handler.
