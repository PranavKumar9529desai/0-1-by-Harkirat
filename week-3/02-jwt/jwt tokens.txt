JsonWebtoken is neihter a hashing no the encryption it is digital signature which is used to verify the authenticity of the message

it has three part 


look at jwt.js to understand how it works


everyone can decode the token but no one can change the token because it is signed with the secret key.
similar to the digital signature as everyone can see the signature but only banks can verify it.


JWT.verify() will throw an error if the token is invalid. You can catch the error and handle it however you want. For example:
function verifyJWT(username,token){
    try {
          jwt.verify(username,secret);
          return true;
          } catch (error) {
          return false; 
      }
  }

Why we use try catch instead 
->as some function throws exception instead of returning boolean value.
