what are sideeffects in React ?
--> side effects are the operations that can't be done during the rendering 
such as data fetching , subscription or manually changing the DOM 


Useffect is like the pit stop is in the race 


todo.map((task,index)=>(
<h2>{task.title}<h2>
<h2>{task.description}</h2>
))


state change is async fun 


Memoization is remembering some output not re computing the output
