Typescript is mainted by Microsoft it is superset of js.
  --->it has strict typing and various other features on top of the js.


so the big question as we know the broswer doesn't understands the typescript neither the node js understands the typescript then how does typescript compilation works .

here what happens

   typescript code get compile down to jsfile by using the command called as "TSC"
what it does is if the code has the any compile time eroor it doesn't create the jsfile.

their other compliar which can do the same job such as esbuild,swc
