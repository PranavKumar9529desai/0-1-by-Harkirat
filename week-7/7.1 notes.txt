React is single page application 

before react come in picture hard reload happens before the new html page comes.

what is bundler ?
--> whole js code that you writtean which will be given the user's application.


what is client side routing ?///
-->  rendering new of compoenents based on routes 


React Routing 

(
    <BrowserRouter>
       <Routes>
        <Route path='/dashboard' element= {<Dashboard/>}    />
        <Route path='/' element= {<Landing/>}    />
        </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>)

{/* here hard reaload happen as route chages so what is the right way */}


useNaviagate right way to dod client side routing 


so we use the useNaviate hook to change routes smoothly to avoid hard reload in react 
you can't use the navigate hook outside the <Browser></Browser>


function Appbar(){
     const naviagete = useNavigate();           // iniliaing the useNavigate hook
 
     return (
     <div>
      <button onClick={()=>{
          naviagete('/dashboard');
         }}>Dashboard</button>

         <button onClick={()=>{
          naviagete('/');
         }}>Landing page</button>
     </div>)
   }


// so we create the new component and then use it render inside the <Browser>



what are props drilling ?
--> basically if parent wants to send the props to the child the state needs to pass from every child before the desitination . 

so the contextApi are introduced in order to teleport the props to the destination directly without passing it from every child .


here is how you use the contexapi 

you create a teleporter which can directly passes the props from the parent from the child 

here how you create the teleporter 

       import { createContext } from 'react';

       export const CountContext = createContext(0) ;

and you wrap the components which wants to send the teleported value inside the provider 
here is the code 

<CounContext.provider value={count}
<Count />
<CountContext.provider / >
